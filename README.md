## Introduction

The clock is one of the most important devices in civilization. Everything we 
know is dependent on time, whether it be your everyday routine, TV 
programming or travel.
For this project our team choose to simulate a clock on the DE2i-150 board. Our 
goal is to get to know the function of the working digital clock, how to utilize 
the DE2i-150 board in order to make this project. Moreover, we get to practice
our Verilog coding skill using the Quartus program.
On the board there are 7 LEDs that show you the time. The HEX0 led shows 
the mode which show you the mode that you can change the index of time. In
mode 0, it runs the time normally. In mode 1, you can change the second, in 
next 2 modes it will change minute and hour respectively. HEX2 and HEX3 
show the second index. HEX4 and HEX5 show the minute index. HEX6 and 
HEX7 show the hour index. We use 3 another KEYs. The first KEY0 to change 
the mode that we showed. 2 others keys use to increase and decrease the 
index of 3 units of times. Second, minute and hour. When in mode 1 you can 
only change the second 2 others can not be changed.
